    TechYes! #9: Check Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself (emotionally)"
    date: "When: Wednesday, June 28, 2017 <br>
    Where: Greenhouse Software, 110 5th, 3rd Fl

    paragraph: |
      Ever dive into a conversation about topics rooted in diversity, inclusion, and your personal experiences and have it go from real casual to emotionally charged? Maybe you were talking to your manager during a 1:1. Perhaps it was your distant relative at some family reunion. Regardless of the situation, some conversations and experiences inevitably come with a slew of emotions that are sometimes difficult to process. How can we check on our range of emotions and process them so that they help instead of hinder?
      
      We're excited to announce that we're partnering with LifeLabs Learning to provide you with a workshop on regulating emotions!
      
      This workshop will be taught by Tania Luna, Partner & Facilitator at LifeLabs Learning. Tania specializes in organizational psychology, emotion regulation, and surprise psychology. She is a leadership trainer, researcher, TED speaker, and co-author of the book Surprise: Embrace the Unpredictable & Engineer the Unexpected. 
      
      Our friends at Jopwell are hosting the event! 
      
      Jopwell helps Black, Latino/Hispanic, and Native American students and professionals unlock opportunities for career advancement, not only when looking for a job but at all career stages. Jopwell’s mission is twofold: Make a substantial, measurable impact on increasing Black, Latino/Hispanic, and Native American representation and to facilitate a national dialogue about diversity in the workplace. Sign up to get connected with top opportunities.
      
      As always, dinner and drinks will be served at 6:30pm. We'll start the official event at 7:00pm. Can't wait to see you all there!"
