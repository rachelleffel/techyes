For our next event we will be partnering with Harlem Tech Fund (HTF) to spend time discussing 'What does it mean to be a trailblazer?'. Jessica O. Matthews, CEO of Uncharted Play (UP) and Chairman of the Board at Harlem Tech Fund, will kick off this discussion by sharing her own journey as a trailblazer.

At the age of 19, Jessica invented the SOCCKET ball, an energy generating soccer ball that provides off-grid power for the developing world. At the age of 22, she founded Uncharted Play, a renewable energy company specializing in motion-based, miniaturized power systems. Jessicaâ€™s research and career centers around the intersection of disruptive technology, human behavior, and the psychology of self-actualization. A dual citizen of Nigeria & the U.S., Jessica has a degree in Psychology and Economics from Harvard University, and an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Members of Harlem Tech Fund and TechYes! will then share their own experiences with trailblazing. To continue the conversation, we ultimately want to hear from you! What are some ways that you have blazed a trail in the past? What are some experiences that you are going through now? We hope that through this discussion, we'll expand our definition and understanding of what it means to be a trailblazer.

Please join us in Harlem at HTF's offices for this exciting event! Refreshments and quality conversation will be provided.
